## Acknowledgments

* I'd like to thank the class repositories for being available to view and reference to get ideas on certain styles and what not
* w3schools always an MVP when trying to figure out certain properties. They also had nice templates for reference which allowed me to get a vague idea of how I wanted to layout my page. Wireframing :)
